When you are working every day on something, you don't take the time very often to think about the big picture. I don't want to lose sight of what I would like Monica to accomplish - so here is what I’d like to do in 2018. This post is not a roadmap per se. Think of it as my very own Wishlist.

* **Launch the mobile application**. The work has already started and we are close to a v1 that should ship in the coming weeks. The first version will be read only, and v2 will allow the edition of data. The code of the mobile application is [already on GitHub](https://github.com/monicahq/chandler), and is 100% open source (obviously).
* **GraphQL support**: we already have a REST API that the v1 of the mobile application will use. If we truly want a great mobile application, we need to make sure that all the requests made to the API are efficient and GraphQL is the best solution for this.
* **Support for Carddav and Caldav**. I believe this is what will make Monica shine on the long run. These two protocols will let you sync your contacts and calendar entries with your existing mail and calendar apps on mobile or desktops. Monica would become the central source of your social data.
* **More love to reminders**, with the possibility to be warned before an event actually happens.
* **Provide statistics about your social life**: how much time you went out a given month, who do you see the most, where do you hangout the most, etc… The more data you feed to Monica, the more insights you’ll have.
* **A calendar view** that shows reminders, future events,…
* **The concept of “rich” activity sheets**: for instance, if you indicate that you went to a restaurant, have the ability to set where it was (with automatic placement on a map), what you’ve eaten, how long it took, etc… Each type of activities would have specific information to fill.
* **The journal** should become the place where your life is auto documented. This will be great once we’ll have rich activity sheets.
* **Stabilize the platform**, add a lot of tests to make sure we don't break things as we move forward.
* If I have the time, but only if I do: **make the app prettier**. However I believe it’s more important to have a functional application than a good looking one.
* And last but not least: **add more ways of importing data**. This will be a real pain as, surprisingly, most social networks or systems are not open source and don't provide you with the data they have on you.

I hope to accomplish all the points above this year. I also know that things are constantly changing for a variety of reasons, so take it with a grain of salt.
