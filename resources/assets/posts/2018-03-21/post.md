We have received [our first award](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3263736/open-source-tools/the-best-open-source-rookies-of-2018.html): Open Source Rookie of the Year 2018, which recognizes some of the most innovative and influential open source projects launched each year. It’s great to see Monica being recognized, but the community should be recognized as well. It’s thanks to you, the community, that we are here today. You are the driving force behind this project, the reason we are building it, and you help decide what we should build next. I’m proud to be part of this adventure.

Let’s make this project a great story.
