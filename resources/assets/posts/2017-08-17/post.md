We've just reached an amazing milestone.

This is amazing and a great milestone that I'd like to share with you all. Users
have uploaded more than 50 000 contacts on Monica so far, and it keeps growing
every day. This doesn't include the instances that have been downloaded and
installed on their own servers.

On a personal note, I'm amazed by the community around the project. On GitHub,
we've received over 200 pull requests from the community and people seem to
share the project all around Internet to spread the good news.

I can wait to see where we'll be one year from now. Thank you all for your
trust.
