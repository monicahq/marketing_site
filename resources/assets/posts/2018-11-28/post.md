I've just removed the mobile applications from both Apple Store and Play Store. The only way to get them is now to build them from the GitHub repository.

While [Theo](https://github.com/Mokto) has done an amazing job on the first version of those apps, the development has stopped at the beginning of this summer and since then, the development of Monica, the platform, has moved forward. We were now in a situation where the mobile app was not on par with the platform and worse, we will break things in the API that the mobile app doesn't support.

I still strongly believe that the growth and adoption of Monica will go through a mobile app.

I would like to promise wonderful things and announce that you'll have a new mobile app in 2 months - but in reality, I don't know how much time it will take to have a great mobile app for Monica. Since Monica is still at the side project stage, it might take 6 months, or 2 years. But one day we'll have a great mobile application, as good as the web version (if not better).

Thanks for your patience.
