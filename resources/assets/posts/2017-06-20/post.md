Monica is meant to host all the private information about your contacts. By
nature, this is personal, and private. However, there are some cases where you
would want to share these information to someone else - your spouse for
instance. It's easy how Monica, in a context of a couple, can help the couple as
a single entity to organize the relationships they have with their loved ones.

To address this use case, we are introducing the support for multiple users in a
single account.

![Image representing the multi user support](/img/posts/2017-06-20-multi-user-support.png)

Adding users happens via email. As a security measure, the person you invite by
email will have to enter the email of the user who has invited her upon
registering.

You'll find user management when you click on the **Settings** tab in your
account.

## Subscriptions

This feature is the first paid feature. The paid plan is called **Chandler** and
costs USD $10 per month. This plan is only available on
[https://monicahq.com](https://monicahq.com) and does not affect self hosted
installations. If you host Monica on your own server, you have access to paid
features for free.

[Take a look at the pull request](https://github.com/monicahq/monica/pull/359)
to know more about this.
