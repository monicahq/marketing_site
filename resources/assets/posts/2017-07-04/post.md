Only 5 days since v0.2.0 and yet another big release. So big that it required a
new version for this.

When you have a lot of contacts in your account, you can now categorize your
contacts with tag. Tags are like folders, but you can have multiple tags for
one contact. This allows maximum flexibility to manage contacts the way you
want it to do.

Tags can be entered right below the contact name.

Once contacts have tags, you can see them on the contact list, and click on
them to filter the list.

Finally, you can delete tags either on the contact view, or in a new Settings
panel created for this purpose.

Version 0.3.0 is already in production, and as always, you can install it on a
server that you own.

Enjoy!
