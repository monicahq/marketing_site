I've been a bit less active on the communication side in the last 40 days. I'm
also slower at responding to issues and merging pull requests. This is not a
situation that I like, but it's difficult for me to change it in the next month
or so. It'll get better though.

## What the hell am I doing right now

I'm working as much as I can on the project. Every free hour that I have is
invested on Monica. To reassure all the people who keep sending me emails about
my commitment on the project and the fact that I won't let it die soon: I'm
still extremely motivated about it as I was before and this is still a priority
for me.

However I'm working at the moment on the API and making sure that it works like
it should. I'm also building the documentation around it, because documentation
has to be excellent in order for people to use the API. For these reasons, and
also because this is still a side project at the moment until I find ways to
make it my full-time job, I don't want to be distracted by the feedback, bugs
or new features right now. As soon as the API will be done, I'll go back to
answering to the community. Unfortunately, I simply don't have the physical
time to do all the things I would like to do, and I need to focus extremely
aggressively if I want to get things done.

## What's next

In the coming days, a first draft of the API will be released - with new methods
added after that.

Once the API is done, we need to focus on giving some love to the notion of
activities done with your contacts. We should also make the dashboard more
useful, and change the Journal so it becomes something actually useful. Also,
we need to implement the Carddav protocol, although I'm unsure at this point how
well it will integrate in the current stack.

I'm sure this project has an enormous potential. If you are a current user, I'm
still looking for <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfaAds4I5F9zLisQpC221pcF0KEkjTPH-koN96D64QFem6uZg/viewform?usp=sf_link">feedback and testimonials</a>. Thanks for your help!
