At its core, Monica is about logging information about the people you care about. While you can log a lot of stuff already, you didn't have a way to easily record what you said to someone at any point of time.

With our [latest update](https://www.monicahq.com/changelog), you can now log a conversation that you have had with someone on social media, by SMS or using Telegram, for instance. The interface we've chosen for this mimics the user interface used by popular chatting tools.

When you log a conversation, you can indicate the mean of communication you've had this conversation with. This list of means is pulled from the contact field types defined in your Settings page.

We hope that you will make good use of this new feature.
