      <p class="measure lh-copy">We aim to have the simplest refund policy as possible: if you are unhappy with the product, for any reason, just contact us and we'll take care of you.</p>
      <p class="measure lh-copy">If you were just charged for your next month of service but you meant to cancel, weâ€™re happy to refund that extra charge.</p>
      <p class="measure lh-copy">If you were just charged for your next year of service but meant to cancel, we're also happy to refund the extra charge.</p>
      <p class="measure lh-copy">However, please keep in mind that we are still a side project, and that every refund is costly for us. So while we'll happily refund, we try to avoid it as much as possible.</p>
