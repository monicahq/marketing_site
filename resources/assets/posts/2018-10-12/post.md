I don't like Facebook. It's not a secret. But despite their general evilness, they have some nice features here and there. One of them is the ability to track life events that happened to you. Such as indicating when you had a surgery or when you did renovations in your home. While I don't understand why you would give this information to Facebook, it makes sense to record this type of information about people you care about. So this is what we just shipped.

Life events is now a new tab in the Profile page of a contact.

You have access to 45+ life events that you can document. You can also set a reminder for each one of these events.

Note that you can add an event without knowing the month or the day it happened.

Once a life event is added, it will appear on a timeline that will be improved in an upcoming release.

I hope you will like this feature and have fun with it.
