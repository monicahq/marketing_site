      <h3 class="mb-3">Scope of service</h3>
      <p class="measure lh-copy">Monica supports the following browsers:</p>

        <li>Chrome (latest)</li>
        <li>Safari (latest)</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">I do not guarantee that the site will work with other browsers, but it's very likely that it will just work.</p>

      <h3>Rights</h3>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">You don't have to provide your real name when you register to an account. You do however need a valid email address if you want to upgrade your account to the paid version, or receive reminders by email.</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">You have the right to close your account at any time.</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">You have the right to export your data at any time, in the SQL format.</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">Your data will not be intentionally shown to other users or shared with third parties.</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">Your personal data will not be shared with anyone without your consent.</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">Your data is backed up every hour.</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">If the site ceases operation, you will receive an opportunity to export all your data before the site dies.</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">Any new features that affect privacy will be strictly opt-in.</p>

      <h3>Responsibilities</h3>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">You will not use the site to store illegal information or data under the Canadian law (or any law).</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">You have to be at least 18+ to create an account and use the site.</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">You must not abuse the site by knowingly posting malicious code that could harm you or the other users.</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">You must only use the site to do things that are widely accepted as morally good.</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">You may not make automated requests to the site.</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">You may not abuse the invitation system.</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">You are responsible for keeping your account secure.</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">I reserve the right to close accounts that abuse the system (thousands of contacts with hundred of thousands of reminders for instance) or use it in an unreasonable manner.</p>

      <h3>Other important legal stuff</h3>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">Though I want to provide a great service, there are certain things about the service I cannot promise. For example, the services and software are provided “as-is”, at your own risk, without express or implied warranty or condition of any kind. I also disclaim any warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement. Monica will have no responsibility for any harm to your computer system, loss or corruption of data, or other harm that results from your access to or use of the Services or Software.</p>

      <p class="measure lh-copy">These Terms can change at any time, but I'll never be a dick about it. Running this site is a dream come true to me, and I hope I'll be able to run it as long as I can.</p>
